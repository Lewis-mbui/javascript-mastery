# JavaScript Mastery Journey

This repository is my personal learning log as I work through mastering the core concepts of JavaScript. I’ve already covered the fundamentals (including OOP) and now I’m taking time to truly deepen my understanding by practicing daily challenges, writing notes, and tracking progress.

The repo is not a tutorial or a resource for others, it’s mainly for me to practice, reflect, and see how far I’ve come. That said, if you’re browsing, you’ll be able to follow along with my progress and see the kinds of exercises I’ve been working on.

## 📂 Repo Structure

- Each **concept** (e.g., Variables, Functions, Arrays, OOP) has its own folder.
- Inside each concept folder, I create **dayX** folders (Day 1, Day 2, etc.).
- Each day contains:

  - `exerciseX.js` files → solutions to daily challenges
  - `README.md` → my notes, reading references, and reflections

Example:

```
02-functions/
   ├── day1/
   │   ├── exercise1.js
   │   ├── exercise2.js
   │   └── README.md
   └── README.md   <-- progress tracker for this concept
```

## 🗓️ Daily Routine

- **Reading**: Each day I start by reading a reference (MDN, Eloquent JS, or a summary).
- **Exercises**: I complete a few progressively harder challenges.
- **Reflection**: I write short notes on what I learned, what clicked, and what I need to revisit.

## 🎯 Goal

By the end of this journey, I want to:

1. Have a **deep understanding** of JavaScript fundamentals.
2. Build a solid **portfolio of exercises and notes** I can revisit anytime.
3. Gain confidence in my programming and problem solving skills.
